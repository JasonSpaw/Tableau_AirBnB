- The purpose of this project was demonstrate my ability to create visualizations and dashboards in Tableau for analysis.

The visuals give a good initial analysis on how a client might want to invest in realestate.  The dashboard shows that there is an increasing trend for the average rental price of AirBnBs to the number of bedrooms, along with the average rental price over zip code.  The bottom right visual shows that rental prices are lowest in the beginning of the year and increase during the holiday season towards the end of the year.
